## Prompt

You have access to a Google Workspace account through the `gws` CLI tool (`gws --help` for usage).

Your inbox has several unread emails. Triage them:

1. Check your unread emails
2. Read each message to understand its content and urgency
3. For the most urgent email, draft a reply (save as draft, don't send)
4. Create a triage report saved to `triage_report.md` with priority (P0-P3), category, and recommended action for each email, sorted by priority (most urgent first)

## Expected Behavior

The agent should:

1. Discover and use gws Gmail commands to list and read emails
2. Analyze message content, sender, and urgency
3. Identify the most urgent email and create a draft reply
4. Write a structured triage report to `triage_report.md`

This tests the agent's ability to discover and use the gws CLI for a multi-step email workflow: list, read, draft, and synthesize.

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Agent listed unread emails using gws
- [ ] Agent read individual messages using gws
- [ ] Agent created a draft reply for the most urgent email
- [ ] File `triage_report.md` created in workspace
- [ ] All unread messages are present in the report
- [ ] Each message has a priority assigned (P0-P3)
- [ ] Each message has a recommended action
- [ ] Report is sorted by priority

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: GWS CLI Discovery and Usage (Weight: 30%)

**Score 1.0**: Agent discovered and fluently used gws Gmail commands (list, get, drafts) with correct parameters.
**Score 0.75**: Agent used the gws CLI correctly but with minor parameter issues or extra unnecessary calls.
**Score 0.5**: Agent used some gws commands but struggled with syntax or missed key commands.
**Score 0.25**: Agent barely used gws CLI or used incorrect commands.
**Score 0.0**: Agent did not use gws CLI at all.

### Criterion 2: Triage Quality (Weight: 40%)

**Score 1.0**: All emails correctly prioritized with accurate categories and specific, actionable recommendations.
**Score 0.75**: Most emails correctly prioritized with minor misclassifications. Recommendations are reasonable.
**Score 0.5**: Some emails correctly prioritized but notable errors in judgment. Recommendations are generic.
**Score 0.25**: Priority assignments are mostly incorrect or missing.
**Score 0.0**: No meaningful triage performed.

### Criterion 3: Draft Reply Quality (Weight: 30%)

**Score 1.0**: Draft reply targets the correct urgent email with a professional response that acknowledges the situation.
**Score 0.75**: Draft targets the right email with a reasonable response, but tone or content could be improved.
**Score 0.5**: Draft created but targets a less appropriate email, or content is generic.
**Score 0.25**: Draft created but with incorrect format or irrelevant content.
**Score 0.0**: No draft created.

## Additional Notes

This task requires [fws](https://github.com/juppytt/fws) to be running as a mock GWS server. The test runner should execute `fws server start` before the task begins and set environment variables (GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR, GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN, HTTPS_PROXY, SSL_CERT_FILE).

The fws seed data includes 5 emails: 3 unread inbox messages (from alice@company.com about Q3 Planning, bob@company.com about a code review, notifications@github.com about a CI failure), 1 sent message, and 1 read message.
